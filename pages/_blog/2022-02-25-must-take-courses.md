2. ### Machine Learning - Stanford University

    > This is a bit on the difficult side since its too long and dense but if you are able to finish the full course and understand it you can say "I know Machine Learning". Even most people with advanced degrees miss this concepts and I always want to go back and master this course.

3. ### Deep Learning Specialization

    > This is intermidate level course that is designed to make you and expert in machine learning and deep learning. The course is recently updated and even though I took the previous version on it i highely advise taking it.
