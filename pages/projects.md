--------------------------------------------------

1. ### Exploring Data Imbalance and Modality Bias inHateful Memes
> Multi-modal memes which consist of an image and text are very popular on social
media but can sometimes be intentionally or unintentionally hateful. Understanding
them and if they are hateful frequently requires to consider image and text jointly.
Naturally, hateful memes appear less frequent than non-hateful ones, creating a
data imbalance in addition to modality biases present between the language and
visual modality. In this work, we study the Hateful Memes dataset and evaluate
several approaches to reduce data imbalance. In our experiments we show that
simple dataset balancing and image augmentation can reduce the most concerning
error, namely overlooking hateful content, significantly (175 to 112 errors), at a
slight increase of overall accuracy.<br>

2.  ### An Amharic News Text classification Dataset
 >  In NLP, text classification is one of the primary problems we try to solve and its uses in language analyses are indisputable. The lack of labeled training data made it harder to do these tasks in low resource languages like Amharic. The task of collecting, labeling, annotating, and making valuable this kind of data will encourage junior researchers, schools, and machine learning practitioners to implement existing classification models in their language. In this short paper, we aim to introduce the Amharic text classification dataset that consists of more than 50k news articles that were categorized into 6 classes. This dataset is made available with easy baseline performances to encourage studies and better performance experiments.<br>

3. ### MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages
    > We take a step towards addressing the under-representation of the African continent in NLP research by creating the first large publicly available high-quality dataset for named entity recognition (NER) in ten African languages, bringing together a variety of stakeholders. We detail characteristics of the languages to help researchers understand the challenges that these languages pose for NER. We analyze our datasets and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art methods across both supervised and transfer learning settings. We release the data, code, and models in order to inspire future research on African NLP.<br>

4. ### Quality at a Glance: An Audit of Web-Crawled Multilingual Datasets

    > With the success of large-scale pre-training and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of languages. We manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4). Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15 corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with low-quality data releases.<br>

6. ### Image Retrieval in Pytorch
    > This Project implements image retrieval from large image dataset using different image similarity measures based on the following two approaches. <br>
        >> . Based on Siamese Network <br>
        >> . Using Resnet pre-trained Network to extract features and store them based on LSH simmilarity to get faster responce for large dataset. <br>

6. ### Amharic Online Handwriting Recognition
    > Using the touch screen capabilities of handhelds input method which is similar to handwriting is
            the best way to replace the current text entry approach. most people learn writing by using a pen
            and a pencil not a keyboard so writing on a touchscreen device like you write on a piece of paper
            is the natural and easiest way for the users .users can stroke their hand on a given canvas and the
            application reads what they write .
            Online handwriting recognition (OHWR) is getting renewed interest as it provides data entry
            mechanism that is similar to natural way of writing.
            This project mainly focuses on using this technique to solve the problem mentioned above. The
            online handwriting recognition project is not new idea .in recent years many researchers are
            adopting this method for their language use.
