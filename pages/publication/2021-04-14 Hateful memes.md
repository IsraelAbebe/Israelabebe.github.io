title: "Exploring Data Imbalance and Modality Bias in Hateful Memes"
abstract: "Multi-modal memes which consist of an image and text are very popular on social
media but can sometimes be intentionally or unintentionally hateful. Understanding
them and if they are hateful frequently requires to consider image and text jointly.
Naturally, hateful memes appear less frequent than non-hateful ones, creating a
data imbalance in addition to modality biases present between the language and
visual modality. In this work, we study the Hateful Memes dataset and evaluate
several approaches to reduce data imbalance. In our experiments we show that
simple dataset balancing and image augmentation can reduce the most concerning
error, namely overlooking hateful content, significantly (175 to 112 errors), at a
slight increase of overall accuracy."
