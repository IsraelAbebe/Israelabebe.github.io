title: "EthioLLM: Multilingual Large Language Models for Ethiopian Languages with Task Evaluation"
abstract: "Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their outstanding performance in various
            downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, low-resource languages are still lagging
            behind current state-of-the-art (SOTA) developments in the field of NLP due to insufficient resources to train
            LLMs. Ethiopian languages exhibit remarkable linguistic diversity, encompassing a wide array of scripts, and are
            imbued with profound religious and cultural significance. This paper introduces EthioLLM – multilingual large
            language models for five Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Ge’ez, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya) and English,
            and Ethiobenchmark – a new benchmark dataset for various downstream NLP tasks. We evaluate the performance of these models across five downstream NLP tasks. We open-source our multilingual language models,
            new benchmark datasets for various downstream tasks, and task-specific fine-tuned language models and discuss the performance of the models. Our dataset and models are available at the EthioNLP HuggingFace repository. "
