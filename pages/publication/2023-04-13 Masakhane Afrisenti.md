title: "Masakhane-Afrisenti at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis using
Afro-centric Language Models and Adapters for Low-resource African
Languages"
abstract: "In this paper, we describe our submission
for the AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 of
SemEval-2023. The task aims to perform
monolingual sentiment classification (sub-task
A) for 12 African languages, multilingual sentiment classification (sub-task B), and zeroshot sentiment classification (task C). For subtask A, we conducted experiments using classical machine learning classifiers, Afro-centric
language models, and language-specific models. For task B, we fine-tuned multilingual pretrained language models that support many of
the languages in the task. For task C, we
used we make use of a parameter-efficient
Adapter approach that leverages monolingual
texts in the target language for effective zeroshot transfer. Our findings suggest that using
pre-trained Afro-centric language models improves performance for low-resource African
languages. We also ran experiments using
adapters for zero-shot tasks, and the results
suggest that we can obtain promising results
by using adapters with a limited amount of resources."
