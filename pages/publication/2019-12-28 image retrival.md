title: "Natural Language Processing in Ethiopian Languages: Current State, Challenges, and Opportunities"
abstract: "This survey delves into the current state of
natural language processing (NLP) for four
Ethiopian languages: Amharic, Afaan Oromo,
Tigrinya, and Wolaytta. Through this paper,
we identify key challenges and opportunities
for NLP research in Ethiopia. Furthermore,
we provide a centralized repository on GitHub
that contains publicly available resources for
various NLP tasks in these languages. This
repository can be updated periodically with
contributions from other researchers. Our objective is to identify research gaps and disseminate the information to NLP researchers interested in Ethiopian languages and encourage future research in this domain."
