title: "Amharic Online Handwriting Recognition"
abstract: "Using the touch screen capabilities of handhelds input method which is similar to handwriting is
            the best way to replace the current text entry approach. most people learn writing by using a pen
            and a pencil not a keyboard so writing on a touchscreen device like you write on a piece of paper
            is the natural and easiest way for the users .users can stroke their hand on a given canvas and the
            application reads what they write .
            Online handwriting recognition (OHWR) is getting renewed interest as it provides data entry
            mechanism that is similar to natural way of writing.
            This project mainly focuses on using this technique to solve the problem mentioned above. The
            online handwriting recognition project is not new idea .in recent years many researchers are
            adopting this method for their language use. "
